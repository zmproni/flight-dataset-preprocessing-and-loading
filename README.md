# Preprocessing and loading of itineraries dataset from Kaggle to MongoDB
This is a script I wrote for a University project meant for personal use and future refrence. 

## Required files
1. .env 
```txt
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING=<connection string>
```

2. itineraries.csv 
source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilwong/flightprices?select=itineraries.csv

## Notes 
This was originally written as a notebook, was later converted to a .py script to call Pool method.
